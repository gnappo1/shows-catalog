# Shows Catalog

## Description

Shows Catalog is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. I built this project because I'm passionate about movies and attend film school. ["http://example.com"](Check out my blog about the project, there I get more into details about some of its features!)

## Installation

To install, just fork and clone this repository. Once you cloned it in your terminal, make sure you `cd` into the correct folder.

## Usage

To get started type `json-server --watch db.json` in the terminal to spin up the server and `open index.html`(for macs) or `explorer.exe index.html` (for windows). The web app will load to an archive and search page where you can see all the movies currently available, al well as create your own.
